Logical Operations with Neural Networks
This project demonstrates the use of a neural network to model and predict the outcomes of two fundamental logical operations: AND and OR. Using Python and the scikit-learn library, specifically the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, it illustrates how a simple neural network can learn to mimic these basic logic gates.

Overview
The code defines and trains two separate MLPClassifier models to understand the AND and OR logical operations. It uses a dataset consisting of all possible binary input combinations for two inputs (0 or 1) and their corresponding output for each logic gate.

Features
Simple Neural Network Implementation: Utilizes scikit-learn's MLPClassifier to model logical operations.
AND & OR Logic Gates: Demonstrates neural network's capability to learn and predict outcomes of basic logic gates.
Training and Prediction: Includes examples of training the models with input-output pairs and using the trained models for prediction.
