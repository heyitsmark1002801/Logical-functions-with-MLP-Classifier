# Logical-functions-with-MLP-Classifier
This project showcases the implementation of a neural network to simulate two of the most elementary logic gates: the AND and OR functions. Using the scikit-learn library's Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, it constructs and trains two separate models to understand and predict the outcomes of these logic operations based on binary inputs.
